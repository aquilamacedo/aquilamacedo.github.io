My name is Aquila Macedo; I am a Computer Science Student from Brazil. I'm
completely passionate about free software. In the last two years, my interests
have gravitated around three things: Operating Systems, Open Source and DevOps.
My main programming languages are C, GoLang, Bash and Python.

As a Debian Maintainer, I am actively involved in the Debian packaging
ecosystem, contributing to multiple package uploads for the Debian Security and
Ruby teams.
