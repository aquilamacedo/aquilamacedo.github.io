My name is Aquila Macedo; I am a Computer Science Student from Brazil. I'm
completely passionate about free software. In the last two years, my interests have
gravitated around three things: Operating Systems, Open Source and DevOps. My main
programming languages are Bash, GoLang and Python.

I am currently actively involved in the Debian software packaging ecosystem, and I
have contributed several package uploads to the Debian Security and Ruby teams.
